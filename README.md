# Memory Recall Simulation with pyClarion
This project implements a memory recall simulation model using the pyClarion framework. The goal is to investigate whether emotional words are more easily recalled than neutral words in a free recall task.

# Requirements
This project uses the default setup of pyClarion, along with Python’s built-in random and datetime modules.
No additional libraries or dependencies are required — everything runs using the standard pyClarion installation.

To run the simulation, simply execute the Python script in any environment where pyClarion is installed.
